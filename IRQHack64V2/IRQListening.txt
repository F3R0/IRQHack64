Fundamentals of Communication from C64 to IRQHack64

1. IRQ line is used to send data from C64 to IRQHack64
2. To keep things simple initially screen is assumed to be off to prevent bad lines and loss of sync.
3. Speed will be second priority.
4. Cartridge will be waiting a startup IRQ sequence to listen to actual commands and data. Hence any program that make use of interrupts will not interfere with the command&data structure of the cartridge.
5. Currently the solution is to manipulate the length of L / H / L transitions of IRQ line. CIA timer A interrupts used with interrupt handling in the cpu disabled.


Possible improvements
1. Force cartridge to listen to NMI (normally an output from cartridge) and use it along with IRQ to increase bandwidth.
2. Add ability of receiving data while screen is enabled.
3. Maximize throughput.
